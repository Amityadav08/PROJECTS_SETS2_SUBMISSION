# Project 2: Financial Management Analytics

## Overview

I conducted comprehensive financial management analytics on the Financial Management dataset, performing detailed analysis across multiple financial dimensions including cash flow, budget analysis, fraud detection, and policy compliance.

## What I Did

- Analyzed monthly spending and income trends across departments
- Conducted budget analysis and utilization tracking by department and category
- Performed cash flow and liquidity analysis
- Implemented fraud and anomaly detection algorithms
- Analyzed transaction behavior and forecasting patterns
- Evaluated approvals and policy compliance metrics
- Generated comprehensive financial insights and recommendations
