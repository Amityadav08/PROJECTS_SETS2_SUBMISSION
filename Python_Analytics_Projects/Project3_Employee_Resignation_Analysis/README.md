# Project 3: Employee Resignation Analysis

## Overview

I conducted comprehensive employee resignation analysis on the Employee Resignation dataset, performing detailed HR analytics to understand resignation patterns, trends, and factors influencing employee turnover.

## What I Did

- Analyzed resignation trends by time (yearly, monthly, quarterly patterns)
- Conducted department-wise resignation analysis
- Performed position/role-based turnover analysis
- Analyzed age demographics and resignation patterns
- Examined gender-based resignation trends
- Conducted salary analysis and correlation studies
- Performed comprehensive cross-analysis across multiple dimensions
- Generated actionable HR insights and retention recommendations

## Key Analysis Areas

### 1. Temporal Analysis

- **Generational Patterns**: Identified generational resignation trends

### 5. Gender Analysis

- **Gender Distribution**: Analyzed resignation patterns by gender
- **Gender-based Metrics**: Calculated resignation rates and percentages
- **Tenure by Gender**: Examined tenure patterns across genders
- **Gender-specific Insights**: Generated gender-specific retention strategies

### 6. Compensation Analysis

- **Salary Distribution**: Analyzed salary ranges of resigned employees
- **Salary-Tenure Correlation**: Studied relationship between salary and tenure
- **Compensation Risk**: Identified salary-related resignation patterns
- **Market Competitiveness**: Assessed compensation competitiveness

### 7. Cross-Dimensional Analysis

- **Department-Position Matrix**: Analyzed resignation patterns across departments and positions
- **Multi-factor Analysis**: Examined interactions between different factors
- **Risk Profiling**: Developed comprehensive risk profiles for employee groups
- **Predictive Insights**: Generated predictive insights for retention planning

## Technical Implementation

- **Data Preprocessing**: Date parsing, tenure calculation, demographic categorization
- **Statistical Analysis**: Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, trend analysis

- **Cross-tabulation**: Multi-dimensional analysis and heatmaps
- **Risk Assessment**: Statistical methods for identifying high-risk groups

## Key Findings

### Resignation Patterns

- **Temporal Trends**: Identified peak resignation periods and seasonal patterns
- **Tenure Analysis**: Analyzed average tenure at resignation across different groups
- **Department Risk**: Identified departments with highest resignation rates
- **Position Risk**: Recognized positions with highest turnover rates

### Demographic Insights

- **Age Patterns**: Analyzed resignation patterns across different age groups
- **Gender Trends**: Examined gender-based resignation differences
- **Compensation Impact**: Studied relationship between salary and resignation likelihood
- **Career Stage Analysis**: Analyzed resignation patterns across career stages

### Risk Factors

- **Short Tenure Risk**: Identified employees leaving within short periods
