# Project 1: Retail Analytics - Superstore Data Analysis

## Overview

I conducted comprehensive retail analytics on the Superstore dataset, performing detailed business analysis across multiple dimensions including sales, profit, customer behavior, and operational efficiency.

## What I Did

- Analyzed profit margins across product categories and sub-categories
- Examined regional and state-level performance metrics
- Investigated discount impact on profitability
- Identified loss-making products and customer segments
- Analyzed delivery performance and shipping efficiency
- Conducted customer behavior and loyalty analysis
- Performed time series analysis for sales and profit trends
- Built predictive models for profit estimation
- Generated actionable business insights and recommendations

## Key Analysis Areas

### 1. Profitability Analysis

- **Category Performance**: Analyzed profit margins across all product categories
- **Sub-category Rankings**: Identified top and bottom performing sub-categories
- **Regional Profitability**: Compared profit performance across different regions
- **Loss-making Products**: Identified products generating negative profits

### 2. Sales Performance

- **State-wise Sales**: Ranked states by total sales volume
- **Monthly Trends**: Analyzed seasonal patterns in sales and profit
- **Customer Segment Analysis**: Compared performance across customer segments
- **Order Value Analysis**: Calculated average order values and patterns

### 3. Customer Behavior

- **Top Customers**: Identified most profitable customers
- **Customer Segments**: Analyzed Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office segments
- **Repeat Purchase Patterns**: Examined customer loyalty and repeat behavior
- **Order Frequency**: Calculated orders per customer metrics

### 4. Operational Analysis

- **Shipping Performance**: Analyzed delivery times by shipping mode
- **Discount Impact**: Examined correlation between discounts and profitability
- **Inventory Efficiency**: Calculated sales per unit metrics
- **Regional Operations**: Compared operational performance across regions

### 5. Predictive Modeling

- **Profit Prediction**: Built linear regression model to predict profit
- **Feature Importance**: Identified key factors influencing profitability
- **Model Performance**: Evaluated model accuracy using R², MSE, and RMSE
- **Business Insights**: Generated actionable recommendations

## Technical Implementation

- **Data Preprocessing**: Date parsing, feature engineering, data cleaning
- **Statistical Analysis**: Aggregations, correlations, trend analysis
- **Visualization**: Comprehensive charts using matplotlib and seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Linear regression for profit prediction
- **Performance Metrics**: Model evaluation with multiple metrics

## Key Findings

### High Performers

- **Top Sub-categories**: Copiers, Machines, Bookcases showing highest profits
- **Best States**: California, New York, Texas leading in sales volume
- **Premium Segments**: Corporate customers showing higher average order values

### Areas of Concern

- **Loss-making Products**: Several products generating negative profits
- **Discount Impact**: Higher discounts correlating with reduced profit margins
- **Delivery Challenges**: Some shipping modes showing longer delivery times

### Business Insights

- **Inventory Optimization**: Focus on high-margin sub-categories
- **Pricing Strategy**: Review discount policies for profitability
- **Customer Retention**: Develop strategies for top-performing customer segments
- **Operational Efficiency**: Optimize shipping modes based on cost-benefit analysis

## Model Performance

- **R² Score**: Model accuracy for profit prediction
- **RMSE**: Root mean squared error for prediction accuracy
- **Feature Importance**: Sales, Quantity, and Discount impact on profit
